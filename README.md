# BindablePicker
Quick example of a bindable picker in Xamarin.Forms

*Note that this example will only work with Xamarin.Forms 2.3.4 and above. As of November 29, 2.3.4 is not on NuGet yet - so you will have to build from source.*

I have the NuGet setup to pull Forms 2.3.3 ... so there **will** be compilation errors. But the point of having this out there is for you to see the code and when 2.3.4 is released update the NuGet to point to that.
